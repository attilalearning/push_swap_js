A working copy of the 42 Push Swap project, it is currently very
inefficient, 1600 operations for 100 numbers and 30000+ operations
for 500 numbers (and it also takes A LOT OF TIME!!! MAYBE 1 MINUTE?).

Still, it can be used to debug an existing solution and to optimize
it, as it is possible to go step by step forward and backward and
view the stacks content at the time.

NOTE: if one uses this on linux, the link.sh can be used to automatically
copy the link from the local filesystem for the test.html and then
paste it into a browser URL via CTRL + V. For this, it is needed to set:

chmod 700 ./link.sh
